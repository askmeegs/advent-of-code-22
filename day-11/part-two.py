Now run 10000 rounds. 
The worry level / 3 is gone. 

Here's the problem. We still have to complete operations and run tests. 
But the numbers get too big. With this implementation, using python, after round 37, things get extremely slow. 

Operations are + or * by a number < 100. 
Tests are of divisibility. 

is there any way to COMPRESS the item value to a smaller number? 

let's say with no compression, the item val is 1056. 
Operation is *4. 

We then have to test divisibility by 8. 
Without compression, we'd do 1056*4 = 4224.
Then 4224 % 8 = 0. 

The problem -- at least part of it -- lies in monkey #2. 
Its operation has you run an exponential function, old^2. 

aka old * old. 
is there any way to somehow get rid of this operation and replace it 
so that it's valid for future operations?

I have to run old * old then test divisibility by 2. what would produce 
the same outcome? 

What is an equivalent operation to old * old / 2 ? 
We're checking odd vs. even. 

an odd * odd = odd
an even * even = even 

so the result of the test will be the same even if we didn't do the operation. 
so instead let's just change the operation from old * old to old * 1. 

the issue with that, though, is that the absolute value of item will be lower.
so subsequent operations like *11, will fundamentally be different once the item
is thrown. 

so that didn't work. 
üôâ TRY AGAIN. 

a common property of all tests is divisibility by a prime number. 
there must be some hint there.... math and I are not friends. ugh ü•π 

https://www.quora.com/Is-the-square-of-a-prime-number-divisible-by-the-same-number-only 
so we know this.. once we HAVE a prime number, and we square it, 
(aka monkey 2 has it) 
the next test -- no matter what -- will result in FALSE because a square
 of a prime is only divisible by itself and 1. 


ok ok ... what if we keep all ops the same, keep squaring things...
BUT. as a way of cutting numbers down, we divide or mod by ... SOME AMOUNT.
instead of dividing arbitrarily by 3, we could MOD by the COMMON DIVISOR of all the prime dividends in all operations? 

let's see if that works...
