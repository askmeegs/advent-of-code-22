üêµ Keep-away 

predict where monkeys will throw items. 
monkeys operate based on "worry level." 
the input is your notes of which items the monkey has, and how the monkey makes decisions

For instance:
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Starting items is the WORRY LEVEL for each item. eg. 
2 items, worry level 79 and 98.

The monkey then inspects an item. 
The operation is how my worry level changes AFTER inspection. 

Test is how the monkey uses worry level to decide where to throw next.

Procedure goes:
1. Monkey inspects an item
2. Relief -  worry / 3 (rounded down to nearest int) 
3. Test worry level --> take action based on test T or F 

When an item is thrown, it goes to the END of the recipient's list. 

On 1 monkey's turn, it inspects ALL ITS ITEMS in the order listed. 
When all monkeys take 1 turn, that = 1 ROUND. 
A monkey could start a round with 0 items, but by its turn, have 3 items. 

If a monkey isn't holding any items, its turn ends immediately. 


TASK - count the total number of items each monkey inspected over
20 ROUNDS. 
Find the two most active monkeys and multiply their item count together. 
This is the "monkey business score." 

Again, return the monkey business score after 20 rounds.
