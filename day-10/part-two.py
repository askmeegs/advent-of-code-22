the value of xreg controls the middle value of a sprite, 3 pixels wide.

xXx 

the CRT is 40 pixels wide, 6 high 
draws left to right, then the next row - like reading a book. 

6 rows 
each row numbered 0-39 

CRT draws 1 pixel per cycle

the sprite cares about me, +1, -1  -- because it's 3 pixels wide.

Task is to render the image of the CRT. In the small.txt, it's noise.
