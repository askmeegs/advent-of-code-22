"""
Ignore the rope metaphors- they're confusing. 

Imagine a worm or caterpillar, with a head and a tail.
The head moves and the tail follows.  "." represents the torso. 
Its body isn't infinitely flexible of course. 
The head and the tail must always be touching, or "connected" via torso. 

At most it can stretch like this T.H  - but the next move must be that the T follows H, so TH. 
The goal is that T must always touch H (either overlapping, in the same row/col, or diagonally touching)

Or 

T
H
.

T
.
H

.
T
H


If you ever see something like 

.H
T.

And H moves further away -- in this case UP 1  --  like 
.H
..
T.

Then T is allowed to move diagonally to be touching again - in this case,  up and to the right. 
.H
.T
..

The task is: assuming that H and T both start overlapping, like "H." 
You're given the movement sequences for HEAD. 
Track the movement of TAIL. 

Part one is to count the positions in the unbounded grid that the tail visited AT LEAST ONCE. So one or more times.
