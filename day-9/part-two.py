GREAT BIG SNAKE 

Now imagine a worm with more joints.
Instead of a head and a tail, you have a head, tail, and 8 joints in between.
For a total of 10. 

The head still moves however it wants.
Each subsequent 9 items move with the same behavior. 
Each knot follows the one DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT. 

if the knots are numbered 0-9... 0 is head, 9 is tail. 
0 moves a step, 1 follows.
1 moves a step, 2 follows... 

all the way to...
8 moves a step, 9 (tail) follows. this is the place to track in "v." 

There is a new tail, knot 10. It moves stepwise after all 9 have moved. 
The task is STILL to track this tail.
